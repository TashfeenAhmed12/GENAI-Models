# Overview
This repository contains projects utilizing pretrained large language models (LLMs) from Hugging Face, which are both fine-tuned in a supervised manner on specific datasets for targeted tasks and compared against traditional NLP methods. The objective is to determine the most effective approach by analyzing the performance of fine-tuned LLMs versus conventional NLP techniques
